I developed this full-stack web application for my Final Capstone project as part of the Chegg Bootcamp Engineering Program. The project utilized React for the client side, Node.js and Express for the API, and PostgreSQL for the database.

The application provides restaurant staff with a user-friendly interface to efficiently manage reservations and table assignments. The dashboard displays reservations by date and shows the status and capacity of all available tables. This allows staff to easily view and handle upcoming reservations on a daily basis.

Key features include:

* Searching for reservations using a mobile number
  
* Creating and updating reservations
  
* Canceling reservations
  
* Seating guests
  
* Marking reservations as finished
  
* Adding new tables to the restaurant layout
